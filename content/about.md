# Hey, I'm Antony

I'm a software engineer working on AI agents at StartGuides. Born in Egypt, now in California.

Most of my work involves building systems that can actually do things autonomously - not just chatbots, but agents that research, make decisions, and take action. Before StartGuides, I was at Genesis Healthcare optimizing genomic data pipelines and deploying enterprise AI. I also somehow ended up co-authoring a research paper on comparative genomics between sloths and humans, which was a fun detour.

When I'm not coding, I play guitar, go to the gym, and nerd out on fitness science. I love cars - I hit up car shows when I can.

My friends tell me I repeat the same interesting facts every couple weeks. They're not wrong.

My favorite book is *Ego is the Enemy* by Ryan Holiday. It's wild how ego sneaks into everything - your wins, your losses, the way you talk to people, the decisions you think are purely logical. Reading it made me realize how much of what I thought was confidence was actually just ego dressed up nice.
