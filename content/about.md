# Hey, I'm Antony

I'm a software engineer based in Orange County, California, currently building AI-powered tools at StartGuides. I'm passionate about creating delightful user experiences and exploring the frontiers of what's possible with artificial intelligence.

## The Short Version

I build web applications and AI systems. I care deeply about developer experience, clean code, and products that actually solve real problems. Currently focused on autonomous AI agents and workflow automation.

## The Longer Story

My journey into software engineering started with curiosity - taking apart how things work and trying to build them better. That curiosity led me to study computer science and eventually to work on some really exciting projects.

These days, I'm particularly fascinated by the intersection of AI and developer tools. How can we make AI agents more reliable? How do we build systems that are both powerful and safe? How do we create workflows that feel magical to use?

## What I Do

**Currently:** Software Engineer at StartGuides, building AI agent workflows for web automation and research.

**Specialties:**
- Full-stack web development (React, TypeScript, Node.js)
- AI/ML systems and agent architectures
- Developer tools and infrastructure
- Cloud platforms (Cloudflare, AWS)

**Interests:**
- LLM applications and prompt engineering
- Web performance and optimization
- Design systems and user experience
- Open source software

## Outside of Work

When I'm not coding, you might find me:

- Reading sci-fi and technology books
- Exploring new restaurants and coffee shops
- Hiking in the California hills
- Tinkering with side projects
- Following Formula 1 racing

## Values & Beliefs

**Learning in public** - Sharing knowledge helps everyone grow

**Quality over speed** - Do it right, even if it takes longer

**User-first design** - Technology should serve people, not the other way around

**Continuous improvement** - There's always a better way to build something
