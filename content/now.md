# What I'm Up To Now

*This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about) - a snapshot of what I'm focused on at this point in my life. Last updated December 11, 2025.*

## Work

**Building AI Agents at StartGuides**

I'm deep into building autonomous AI agent systems that help users research topics and make better decisions. The technical challenges are fascinating:

- Designing reliable tool interfaces for web automation
- Implementing verification systems to ensure agent accuracy
- Optimizing for speed and cost at scale
- Creating intuitive workflows for complex tasks

The field is moving incredibly fast, and we're figuring out what "good" looks like for production AI systems.

## Learning

**Exploring Advanced Agent Architectures**

Currently studying:

- Multi-agent collaboration patterns
- Long-term memory systems for AI
- Prompt engineering at scale
- Vision capabilities for web agents

**Deep Diving into React 19**

Getting hands-on with the new features:
- Server Components and the new mental models
- The `use` hook and async patterns
- Modern form handling with Actions
- Performance optimization techniques

## Reading

**Currently on my nightstand:**

- *The Pragmatic Programmer* (20th Anniversary Edition) - Revisiting the classics
- Various AI research papers on agent architectures and tool use
- Tech blogs about production LLM applications

## Building

**This Website**

Just finished a major redesign of my personal site:
- Moved from a static portfolio to a living blog
- Implemented markdown-based content system
- Designed a warm, cozy aesthetic
- Built with modern React 19 and TypeScript

**Side Projects**

Experimenting with:
- Developer tools for AI workflows
- Browser automation utilities
- Content generation systems

## Life

**Based in Orange County**

Enjoying the California weather and exploring:
- New coffee shops and restaurants
- Hiking trails in the nearby hills
- Local tech community events

**Staying Active**

- Regular gym sessions
- Weekend hikes
- Trying to maintain work-life balance (it's a work in progress!)

## Goals for This Quarter

1. Ship 3 major features for StartGuides AI agents
2. Write 5 blog posts about lessons learned
3. Contribute to 2 open source projects
4. Read 3 technical books cover-to-cover
5. Build one side project I'm proud of
