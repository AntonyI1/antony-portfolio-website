# 2024: A Year in Review

As 2024 draws to a close, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on what has been a transformative year both professionally and personally.

## Professional Growth

This year marked a significant milestone in my career as I dove deeper into AI and machine learning. Working on production AI systems taught me invaluable lessons about the gap between prototypes and production-ready solutions.

### Key Learnings

- **Prompt Engineering is an Art**: Crafting effective prompts requires understanding both the technical constraints of LLMs and the nuances of human language
- **Context Management**: Managing context windows effectively can make or break an AI application
- **User Experience First**: The best AI features are invisible - they just work

## Personal Projects

I shipped several side projects this year, each teaching me something new:

1. **AI Writing Assistant** - Learned about streaming responses and state management
2. **Code Review Bot** - Explored GitHub Actions and webhook integrations
3. **Personal Knowledge Base** - Built a second brain with markdown and search

## What I'm Taking Into 2025

The biggest lesson from 2024? **Ship early, iterate fast.** Perfect is the enemy of good, especially in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

I'm excited to carry this momentum into the new year, with several ambitious projects already in the pipeline.
