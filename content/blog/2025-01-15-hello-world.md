# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is the first post on my newly redesigned website.

I've been wanting to create a more personal space on the internet for a while now. Not just a portfolio or resume site, but a **digital home** where I can share thoughts, learnings, and connect with others in the tech community.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Software Engineering** - Lessons learned from building products
- **AI & Machine Learning** - Exploring the frontiers of what's possible
- **Developer Experience** - Tools and workflows that make us more productive
- **Personal Growth** - Reflections on learning and professional development

## Why Blog?

Writing helps me:

1. **Clarify my thinking** - Explaining concepts forces me to understand them deeply
2. **Share knowledge** - If I struggled with something, others probably did too
3. **Connect with people** - The best conversations start from shared ideas
4. **Document my journey** - It's fun to look back and see how I've grown

## The New Design

This site is built with React 19, TypeScript, and Vite, deployed on Cloudflare Workers. But more importantly, it's designed to feel **warm and inviting** rather than corporate.

I wanted a cozy aesthetic - warm colors, comfortable reading experience, and a personal touch. Think "digital home" rather than "professional portfolio."

Thanks for stopping by. More posts coming soon!
