# Antony Ibrahim - Portfolio

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my work as a software engineer.

I built this to highlight my projects, experience, and skills in a clean, modern way. The site features a dark theme, smooth animations, and is fully responsive.

## What's Inside

- **Experience Timeline** - My career journey from UC Irvine to Genesis Healthcare
- **Projects** - Some of my favorite work including PokeTrader and TombVM
- **Skills** - Organized by category (OCD-friendly)
- **Resume** - Direct download for your convenience

## Tech Stack

- React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- Custom CSS (vanilla, no framework dependencies)
- Cloudflare Workers for hosting

## Getting Started

If you want to run this locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AntonyI1/antony-portfolio-website.git
cd antony-portfolio-website
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev    # Start dev server
npm run build  # Build for production
npm run deploy # Deploy to Cloudflare
```

## Project Structure

Pretty straightforward:
- `src/react-app/` - All the React code
- `public/` - Static assets (including my resume)
- `src/worker/` - Cloudflare Worker setup

## Customization

Want to use this as a template? Go for it! Just update the content in `App.tsx` and `App.css` to make it yours.
