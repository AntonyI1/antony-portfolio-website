# App Spec: Antony Ibrahim Personal Website v2

## Overview

Transform the current portfolio/resume website into a **cozy, personal digital home** that showcases who you are beyond just professional achievements. The site should feel warm and inviting while remaining functional and easy to update.

**Live URL:** https://antony-ibrahim.dev
**Tech Stack:** React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Cloudflare Workers

---

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

All changes for this redesign must be made on a **separate feature branch** - never directly on `main`.

```bash
# Create and work on feature branch
git checkout -b cozy-redesign

# All commits go here until ready for review
```

### Git Configuration

**Author:** Antonyi1
**Email:** Antonyibrahim0@gmail.com

```bash
# Ensure correct author for this repo
git config user.name "Antonyi1"
git config user.email "Antonyibrahim0@gmail.com"
```

### Commit Guidelines

- Commits authored by **Antonyi1 <Antonyibrahim0@gmail.com>**
- No AI/Claude mentions in commit messages
- No co-authored-by tags
- Clear, descriptive commit messages

### Review Process

1. All work stays on `cozy-redesign` branch
2. Branch is **not** merged to main automatically
3. You review the changes and decide if you like them
4. Deploy preview from branch if needed (`wrangler deploy --branch cozy-redesign`)
5. Merge to main only when satisfied

---

## Current State

- Single-page React app with all content hardcoded in `App.tsx`
- Sections: Home, Experience, Publications, Projects, Skills, Contact
- Dark theme with cyan/purple accents
- No content management - requires code changes to update
- ~1000 lines of CSS, monolithic component structure

---

## Goals

1. **More Personal & Cozy** - Warm design that feels like visiting someone's home, not a corporate resume
2. **About Me Page** - Deeper personal content beyond professional achievements
3. **Now Page** - What you're currently focused on, reading, building, learning
4. **Blog Section** - Space to write thoughts, learnings, and share ideas
5. **Easy Content Updates** - Add blog posts and update pages without touching React components
6. **Keep Existing Resume Features** - Experience, projects, skills, publications remain accessible

---

## Site Architecture

### Pages & Routes

```
/                    -> Home (hero + brief intro + recent posts)
/about               -> About Me (personal story, interests, values)
/now                 -> Now Page (current focus, what I'm up to)
/blog                -> Blog Index (list of all posts)
/blog/:slug          -> Individual Blog Post
/work                -> Work/Portfolio (experience, projects, publications, skills)
/resume              -> PDF download redirect
```

### Navigation

```
[Home]  [About]  [Now]  [Blog]  [Work]  [Theme Toggle]
```

---

## Content Management System

### File-Based Content (Markdown)

Create a `/content` directory for easy content updates:

```
content/
├── about.md              # About Me page content
├── now.md                # Now page content (update frequently)
└── blog/
    ├── 2025-01-15-first-post.md
    ├── 2025-02-20-learning-rust.md
    └── ...
```

### Markdown Frontmatter Schema

**Blog Posts (`content/blog/*.md`):**
```yaml
---
title: "My First Blog Post"
date: 2025-01-15
description: "A short description for previews and SEO"
tags: ["thoughts", "programming", "life"]
draft: false
---

Blog content in markdown...
```

**About Page (`content/about.md`):**
```yaml
---
title: "About Me"
lastUpdated: 2025-01-01
---

Content...
```

**Now Page (`content/now.md`):**
```yaml
---
title: "What I'm Up To Now"
lastUpdated: 2025-12-10
location: "Orange County, CA"
---

Content...
```

### Build-Time Content Processing

- Use Vite plugin or build script to process markdown at build time
- Generate JSON manifest of all blog posts for index page
- Convert markdown to HTML with syntax highlighting for code blocks
- No runtime markdown parsing (static generation for performance)

---

## Design System: "Cozy" Theme

### Philosophy

Move from "professional portfolio" aesthetic to "personal digital home":
- Warmer colors instead of cold cyan/purple
- More whitespace and breathing room
- Softer shadows and rounded corners
- Typography that feels personal (consider serif fonts for body text)
- Subtle paper/texture backgrounds (optional)

### Color Palette (Dark Mode - Default)

```css
/* Warm neutrals */
--bg-primary: #1a1814;        /* Warm black, slight brown tint */
--bg-secondary: #252118;      /* Warm dark surface */
--bg-card: #2d2820;           /* Card backgrounds */

/* Text */
--text-primary: #f5f0e8;      /* Warm off-white */
--text-secondary: #a89f94;    /* Muted warm gray */
--text-muted: #6b6359;        /* Subtle text */

/* Accent - warm amber/orange */
--accent-primary: #e8a854;    /* Warm amber */
--accent-secondary: #c9844a;  /* Burnt orange */
--accent-glow: rgba(232, 168, 84, 0.15);

/* Semantic */
--border: #3d352c;
--link: #e8a854;
--link-hover: #f4c076;
```

### Color Palette (Light Mode)

```css
--bg-primary: #faf8f5;        /* Warm cream */
--bg-secondary: #f0ebe3;      /* Light warm gray */
--bg-card: #ffffff;

--text-primary: #2d2820;
--text-secondary: #5c544a;
--text-muted: #8a8279;

--accent-primary: #c9844a;
--accent-secondary: #a66b3a;
```

### Typography

```css
/* Consider a warmer, more personal font stack */
--font-heading: 'Fraunces', 'Georgia', serif;
--font-body: 'Inter', 'system-ui', sans-serif;
--font-mono: 'JetBrains Mono', 'Fira Code', monospace;

/* Sizes with better reading experience */
--text-base: 1.125rem;        /* 18px base for comfortable reading */
--text-lg: 1.25rem;
--text-xl: 1.5rem;
--text-2xl: 2rem;
--text-3xl: 2.5rem;

--line-height-body: 1.7;      /* Generous line height */
--max-width-prose: 65ch;      /* Optimal reading width */
```

### Spacing & Layout

```css
--spacing-page: 2rem;         /* Page padding */
--spacing-section: 4rem;      /* Between sections */
--border-radius: 12px;        /* Softer corners */
--shadow-soft: 0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
```

## Component Structure

Refactor from monolithic `App.tsx` to modular components:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── layout/
│   │   ├── Header.tsx         # Navigation
│   │   ├── Footer.tsx         # Site footer
│   │   └── Layout.tsx         # Page wrapper
│   ├── common/
│   │   ├── ThemeToggle.tsx
│   │   ├── Button.tsx
│   │   ├── Card.tsx
│   │   └── Tag.tsx
│   ├── home/
│   │   ├── Hero.tsx
│   │   └── RecentPosts.tsx
│   ├── blog/
│   │   ├── BlogList.tsx
│   │   ├── BlogPost.tsx
│   │   └── PostCard.tsx
│   └── work/
│       ├── Timeline.tsx
│       ├── ProjectCard.tsx
│       └── SkillsGrid.tsx
├── pages/
│   ├── Home.tsx
│   ├── About.tsx
│   ├── Now.tsx
│   ├── Blog.tsx
│   ├── BlogPost.tsx
│   └── Work.tsx
├── content/                   # Markdown content (processed at build)
├── hooks/
│   ├── useTheme.ts
│   └── useBlogPosts.ts
├── styles/
│   ├── globals.css
│   ├── variables.css
│   └── typography.css
├── lib/
│   └── content.ts             # Content loading utilities
└── App.tsx                    # Router setup
```

---

## Routing

Use **React Router** (react-router-dom) for client-side routing:

```tsx
<BrowserRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
    <Route path="/now" element={<Now />} />
    <Route path="/blog" element={<Blog />} />
    <Route path="/blog/:slug" element={<BlogPost />} />
    <Route path="/work" element={<Work />} />
    <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
```

Cloudflare Workers already configured for SPA routing (`not_found_handling: "single-page-application"`).

---

## Content Pipeline

### Option A: Build-Time Processing (Recommended)

1. **Vite Plugin** processes markdown files during build
2. Generates:
   - `dist/content/about.json`
   - `dist/content/now.json`
   - `dist/content/blog/index.json` (manifest)
   - `dist/content/blog/[slug].json` (individual posts)
3. React app fetches JSON at runtime
4. No markdown parsing in browser

**Recommended Tools:**
- `gray-matter` - Parse frontmatter
- `marked` or `remark` - Markdown to HTML
- `shiki` or `prism` - Syntax highlighting

### Option B: Import at Build Time

Use Vite's import.meta.glob to import markdown files directly:

```tsx
const posts = import.meta.glob('/content/blog/*.md', { eager: true, as: 'raw' });
```

Process during build, no runtime fetching.

---

## New Dependencies

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-router-dom": "^7.x"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "gray-matter": "^4.x",
    "marked": "^15.x",
    "shiki": "^1.x"
  }
}
```

---

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Create `cozy-redesign` branch
2. Add React Router
3. Set up new component structure
4. Create Layout component with new navigation
5. Implement theme system with warm colors

### Phase 2: New Pages
1. Create About page with placeholder content

2. Create markdown processing pipeline
3. Implement blog post rendering
4. Add syntax highlighting

### Phase 4: Polish
1. Refine typography and spacing
2. Add transitions between pages
3. Mobile optimization
